# Problem Statement

Freelancers and clients working globally face significant trust issues when it comes to payments, deliverables, and dispute resolution.

Traditional freelance platforms act as centralized intermediaries, controlling funds, charging high fees, and enforcing opaque dispute decisions. These systems create:
- Delayed payments for freelancers
- High platform fees for both parties
- Biased or unclear dispute resolutions
- Lack of transparency in fund handling


## Root Causes

1. **Centralized Control**
   Platforms hold user funds and have full authority over payment release.

2. **Lack of Transparency**
   Users cannot verify how or when funds are managed internally.

3. **Single Authority Dispute Resolution**
   Disputes are resolved by internal teams with no public logic or auditability.

4. **Global Payment Friction**
   Cross-border payments are slow, expensive, and sometimes restricted.


## Proposed Solution

TrustLance is a decentralized freelance escrow platform that leverages blockchain smart contracts to enforce trust without intermediaries.

Key principles:
- Funds are locked on-chain in escrow contracts
- Payments are released strictly by milestone completion
- Disputes are resolved through decentralized DAO voting
- All transactions are transparent and verifiable


## Success Criteria

The platform is successful if:
- Freelancers receive guaranteed, automated payments upon milestone approval
- Clients retain control until agreed work is delivered
- No central authority can manipulate funds
- Dispute outcomes are transparent and enforceable on-chain
